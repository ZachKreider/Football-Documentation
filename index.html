    <article>
      <p>Harvard University maintained its distance by sticking to a rugby-soccer hybrid called the “Boston Game.” In May 1874, after a match against McGill University of Montreal, the Harvard players decided they preferred McGill’s rugby-style rules to their own. In 1875, Harvard and Yale played their first intercollegiate match, and Yale players and spectators (including Princeton students) embraced the rugby style as well.</p>

    <header>Special Teams</header>
    <article>
      <p>The special teams are made of 11 people just like offensive or defensive. They sometimes will use players who play on either offensive and defensive as well. They always include a kicker of some kind, wether it be a punter or a kicker. I know it may seem confusing but they aren't the same thing.</p>
      <p>There is the Kick-off, this is the opening play of the game. where one team will use a kicker to kick the ball off a tee to the opposing team. Both the kick-off team the recieving team have 11 people. The team that kicks off try to prevent the opposing team to get as many yards as possible. While the recieving team try's to gain as many yards possible on the oppening play. This plays also take place after points have been scored.  </p>
      <p>The Point-After-Touchdown or PAT, this occures when a team scores a touchdown. Whether it be on offense, defense, and even kick-return team or punt-return team. </p>
      <p>The Punt and Punt-Return, this occurs when a team is unable to get a new set of downs. This means a team will need to use a punter to kick the ball to the opposing team to get them away for their scoring endzone. The Punt-Return occurs when an offensive is unable to get a new set of downs, and must kick off. The punt-return team will then try to advance the ball of keep it where is coming down at with a fair catch. This is where a player can catch kicked ball without fear of being tackled by the other team.</p>

      <p>There are 9 possible ways to score points in the game of Football.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          "Offensive Touchdown - 6 points - This can be made by either the quarterback, running back, or reciever running into the endzone with the ball. This can also be done by the quarterback throwing the ball to the running back, tightend, or a reciever, and them running it in the endzone."</li>
        <li>Offensive Field Goal - 3 points - This is made when an offense is close enough for the kicker to kick it in. This is usually done when an offense can't score a touchdown and need the points to win.</li>
        <li>Defensive Touchdown - 6 points - This is achieved with a defensive player either picks a fumbled ball(ball dropped by offensive player during a play) and runs it in for a touchdown. Or an player intercepts the ball from the quarterback who has thrown it.</li>
        <li>Defensive Safety - 2 points - This is achieved when a player taclkes an offensive player with the ball in their own endzone.</li>
        <li>Kick-return Touchdown - 6 points - This is achieve when a player on kick off, returns the ball after kicked for a touchdown.</li>
        <li>Punt-return Touchdown - 6 points - This is achieved when a player on punt-return returns a kicked punt back for a touchdown. </li>
